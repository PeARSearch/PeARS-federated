       <h3>Our privacy policy</h3>

       <p>PeARS is <a href="https://pearsproject.org/">open-source software</a> developed by volunteers and freely available for all to use and modify. It receives development support from the non-profit collective <a href="https://possible-worlds.eu/">Possible Worlds Research</a>.</p>

       <p>This specific instance is run by <i>{{orgname}}</i> ("we"/"us"). You can contact us at:</p>

       <p>{{address}}<br>{{email}}.</p>

       <p>This privacy policy describes how <i>{{orgname}}</i> collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the countercult.info website itself or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that <i>{{orgname}}</i> does not own or control, or to individuals that <i>{{orgname}}</i> does not employ or manage.</p>

       <h4>What information do we collect and what do we use it for?</h4>
       <p>Basic account information: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also be able to enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image. The username, display name, biography, profile picture and header image are always listed publicly. We use the information to create your account and provide you with the core functionality of PeARS. You can only submit new URLS or administer your posts and comments when you are logged in. The email address you provide may be used to send you information about your account, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>

       <p>Contributions and other public information: When you submit a URL, a post or a comment to our PeARS index, the date and time is stored as well as the application you submitted your contribution from. Your contributions are available publicly. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>

       <p>IPs and other metadata: When you use our website or the API we use your IP address and the metadate transferred with it to establish a connection with our servers. When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server. We use the data to ensure functionality and security of our systems and also to aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.  These purposes constitute our legitimate interest. The legal basis is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR. </p>

       <h4>How do we protect your information?</h4>
       <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm.</p>

       <h4>What is our data retention policy?</h4>
       <p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>
       <p>Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.</p>
       <p>Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.</p>
       <p>You can request and download an archive of your content, including your contributions.</p>
       <p>You may irreversibly delete your account at any time. Upon deletion, your username, email and password are removed from our server. Your content (submitted URLs, posts and comments) is moved to an anonymous account managed by the site's administrator (e.g. deleteduser1234). If you wish for your content to be entirely deleted, you can do so from your profile prior to account deletion. You can also contact us to request removal of your data.</p>

       <h4>Do we use cookies?</h4>
       <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow it). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.</p>

       <p>We only use session cookies. We use them to provide you with a way to log in and out of our site, manage your session as you navigate through the site, and recognize you upon future visits.</p>

       <h4>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h4>

       <p>Art. 77 GDPR in conjunction with Section 19 BDSG - Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority at any time, in particular in the Member State in which you are resident, your place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes data protection law.</p>

       <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. </p>

       <p>We will not make you subject to any automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with Art. 22 par. 1 and 4 GDPR, which has legal effects on you or affects you. </p>
